# Learning diary

This document summarizes of what I have learned during this challenge.

## Day 00

I completed the day 1 of year 2021 to create a template for myself this year.

The first part was straight forward and quick to do. However, the second part took longer because at first I read the instructions wrong and the problem became more complicated in my head that it actually was (e.g. the format of the input did not change). After realising the mistake and uderstanding the task, the problem took less than 30min.

I learned how to read text files and how to implement queue in C++. I also learned how to set up a C++ project and how to automate build and launch in vscode.
